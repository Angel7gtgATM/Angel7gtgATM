- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Angel7gtgATM
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in genomics, bioinformatics and genetics in general. Currently, I am working on pharmacogenomics (PGx) projects but I have taken part in projects of Paleogenomics and population genomics. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python, R and bash, but I am pretty novel. At the same time, I am starting to make contact with bioinformatics' techniques and databases.
